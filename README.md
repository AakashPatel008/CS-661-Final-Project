# Deep Learning Emotion detection project

## Description

The "Music Recommendation System Using Emotion Detection with Convolutional Neural Network" addresses the challenge of personalizing music recommendations based on users' emotional states. Traditional music recommendation systems often lack the ability to capture users' current emotions, resulting in less relevant suggestions. This project aims to bridge this gap by employing Convolutional Neural Networks to analyze facial expressions and detect emotions in real-time. By understanding users' emotional states, we provide a more nuanced and emotionally resonant music recommendation experience, enhancing user satisfaction and engagement with their music listening journey.

## Runing instructions
1-> goto Main Program in the end
2-> In this find the Line mood_music=pd.read_csv(r"C:\Users\Aakash Patel\CS-661-Final-Project\Music.csv") and change the path to your own path for Music.csv file
3-> Run the import Library code. 
4->As the Learning model is all ready trained you just need to run the main code
